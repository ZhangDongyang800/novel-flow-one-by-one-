## Quick Start

**Trae users:** Copy the `skills` and `shared` folders into your project's `.trae` directory.

```
your-project/
└── .trae/
    ├── skills/     ← copy here
    └── shared/     ← copy here
```

**Other AI tools:** Tell your AI:
```
Install this skill: https://github.com/ZhangDongyang800/novel-flow-one-by-one.git
```

## Workflow

1. Tell AI your idea (anything works, even just the word "novel"). AI asks you genre, protagonist, world-building etc. — you just pick options (A or B)
2. Confirm the generated `project.md` (project settings) and character cards
3. AI auto-generates chapter outline `outline.md`, you confirm the chapter plan
4. AI writes prose scene by scene, auto-checking for AI-isms and formatting every 300-500 words
5. After you confirm the draft, AI runs a 6-dimension review (plot progress, character change, memorable moments, pacing, emotion, hooks)
6. Review passes → auto-sync setting changes → write next chapter; fails → revise and re-review

## Writing Styles

| Style | Best For | Core Traits |
| :---: | --- | --- |
| **Cold Minimalist** | Realism, historical, mystery, war | Restrained, emotionally subtle |
| **System Power Fantasy** | LitRPG, progression, urban, xianxia | Tension → reversal → payoff, face-slapping |
| **Weird Suspense** | Rule-based horror, infinite flow, Cthulhu, mind games | Rule design, information asymmetry, cognitive intrusion |

## FAQ

**Q: The generated text still has an "AI flavor".**
A: This is normal. AI models have inherent writing patterns. The skill system significantly reduces AI-isms through rules and self-checks, but can't eliminate them 100%. When you spot AI-isms, point them out — the review skill will catch and fix them.

**Q: The workflow got interrupted. What do I do?**
A: Just invoke the `novel-orchestrator` skill. It will check your current state and figure out the next step.
